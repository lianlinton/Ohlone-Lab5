Selection sort: helpful because it helps us in searching for the smallest element in the unsorted sublist.

Some sorting algorithms have better time and/or memory efficiency than others. It really depends on the applications and what the program is trying to accomplish.

Merge sort:  It allows to programmer to sort the data structure in half, from this it then merges the sorted sub arrays into one.

Analyzing the performance of algorithms - Being able to analyze the performance of algorithms is important as generally the faster, more efficient algorithm is preferable

Selection sort - This is important to know because it works well with smaller lists and has good memory usage

Linear search: Searching is a common task and linear search is one way to search, linear search means to look for an element in an array or list and inspeacting it.

Quick sort：quick sort is useful for sorting array. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot
